hi hello chamak challo :P

Install "latest" version of django in your system.

For Checking whether django that you have installed is working, execute the following commands in terminal:

>>python				"type python in the terminal."

>>>from django import get_version 	"execute this command in the python shell. "

if you don't get an error then you can proceed to the next command, else hard luck... :(
	
>>>get_version()     			"execute this command in the python shell after executing the above command."

this should give you the version of django installed in your system.

test execute this command
>> django-admin.py     			"this should show you a list of commands."

if you get an error saying command not found, make sure the path to django-admin.py is in your path variable and django-admin.py is executable.

to test the project move to the directory "Ecodena" and then execute the following command

>>python manage.py runserver


"Happy Coding"
