# Welcome to Ecodena, the Online Judge System.

Install "latest" version of django in your system.

For Checking whether django that you have installed is working, execute the following commands in terminal:

>>python				"type python in the terminal."

>>>from django import get_version 	"execute this command in the python shell. "

if you don't get an error then you can proceed to the next command, else hard luck... :(
	
>>>get_version()     			"execute this command in the python shell after executing the above command."

this should give you the version of django installed in your system.

test execute this command
>> django-admin.py     			"this should show you a list of commands."

if you get an error saying command not found, make sure the path to django-admin.py is in your path variable and django-admin.py is executable.

to test the project move to the directory "Ecodena" and then execute the following command

>>python manage.py runserver


"Happy Coding"
